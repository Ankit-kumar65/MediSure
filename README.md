# MediSure ( 2nd Position winner in Sociothon 2021 )

We have developed a web application as well as an Android Application(which employs the web app) named MediSure to provide the most economical result matching the prescription
by using data extracted from an open-source sample dataset and JAS medicine prices . We have also provided percentage money saved per standard unit of the prescribed medicine. 
Our team 'CurbYourK-Means' finished 2nd position in Sociothon, a 24 hour virtual hackathon held as a part of the National Social Summit 2021, organised by IIT Roorkee,
